# VLAN-Configuration



## Introduction

In this project, I am creating two VLANS using Cisco Packet Tracer. The lab focuses on configuring tow VLANS on a single switch, with two end points assigned to each VLAN, allwowing for isolated communication between the groups. This project aims to demonstrate
the fundamentals o fVLAN implementation and the role f basic networkdevices such as switches and routers in managing network traffic.

The network setup will be configured  using a command line interface to facilitate precise control over the network settings. This will enhance understanding of VLANS and their configuration process, re-inforcing the skills necessary for effective network management.

In a real world environment, utilzing VLANS to segment a newtork is crucial for enhancing security, improving performance, and simplifying network management for businesses. Proper configuration is vital, as it ensures that network segments fucntion correctly and 
securely, minimizing the risk of unauthrorized accesa dn optimizing resource allocation.
